sdesc: "Light SMTP client with support for server profiles"
ldesc: "A SMTP client that can be used to send mails from Mutt and
probably other MUAs (mail user agents). It forwards mails to an SMTP
server (for example at a free mail provider), which takes care of the
final delivery. Using profiles, it can be easily configured to use
different SMTP servers with different configurations, which makes it
ideal for mobile clients."
